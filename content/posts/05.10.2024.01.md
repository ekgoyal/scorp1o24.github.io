Hello everyone! I'm excited to welcome you to my personal website, where I will share my journey as a Bachelor’s student in Physics at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and my experiences as a Machine Learning Assistant at Tools for Humanity.

## What This Website Is About

This website serves multiple purposes:

1. **Learning Resource**: I plan to create and share resources related to my physics studies, including lecture notes, problem sets, and summaries of key concepts. I hope to provide materials that will help both myself and others understand complex topics better.

2. **Course Information**: As a tutor for physics/mathematics courses at TUM, I will use this platform to detail the courses I teach, including schedules, materials, and links to additional resources. You can find all relevant information under the **Teaching** section.

3. **Personal Development**: I aim to document my journey through my studies and work experiences. This may include insights on machine learning, academic projects, and reflections on my learning process. 

4. **Community Engagement**: I welcome discussions and feedback on my posts. If you have questions, suggestions, or just want to connect, please feel free to reach out via the contact information provided.

## My Goals for This Website

- **Share Knowledge**: I want to create a space where I can share what I learn and contribute to the community of learners, especially those in the fields of physics and machine learning.
  
- **Foster Collaboration**: I hope this platform can serve as a point of connection for students and professionals interested in physics, helping us share ideas and collaborate on projects.

- **Continuous Learning**: By documenting my learning and teaching experiences, I aim to reflect on my growth and identify areas for further development.

I am thrilled to embark on this journey and look forward to sharing valuable insights and resources with you. Thank you for visiting my website!

Feel free to explore the different sections, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!

Best,  
Eklavya
